If you would like to contribute with a new feature, perhaps the best starting point would be to open an issue and get the conversation going. A healthy discussion might give us good ideas about how to do things even before a single line of code gets written which in turn produces better results.

Please apply your changes to the develop branch it makes it a bit easier and cleaner for me to keep everything in order. For extra points in the FLOSS hall of fame, write a few tests for your awesome contribution as well. :) Thanks for your help!
